🚀 Just Launched My Weather App! 🌤️

Over the past few days, I’ve been working on a weather application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, powered by the OpenWeatherMap API. 🌍

Key features:
✅ Live weather data (temperature, condition, wind, humidity)
✅ 5-day forecast at 12 PM
✅ Custom weather icons based on conditions
✅ Error handling for city not found
✅ Responsive UI for all screen sizes

This project taught me a lot about:

Working with real-time APIs

DOM manipulation and event handling

Structuring clean, readable JavaScript

Error handling in async/await functions

💻 Tech stack: HTML5 | CSS3 | JavaScript (Vanilla) | OpenWeatherMap API
